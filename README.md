## About Artificial Neural Network

Artificial Neural Network, is a deep learning API written in Python.
It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.
*Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.*

Artificial Neural Network is:

-   **Simple** 
-   **Flexible** 
-   **Powerful** 

## First contact with Artificial Neural Network

The core data structures of Artificial Neural Network are __consign__ and __result__.
It implement four model in two layer neural network for helping you fast build __predictor__.

Here is an `exemple` :
